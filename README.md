# progressbar-c
Welcome to the "Simple Progress Bar in C" project! This project provides a basic yet effective implementation of a customizable console-based progress bar in the C programming language. A progress bar is a visual indicator that displays the progression of a task, providing users with a clear representation of how much work has been completed.
